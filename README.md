# KiteSpot - Frontend

This is the frontend of my KiteSpot fullstack project. KiteSpot is a kitesurfing specific weather site, providing relevant data to riders to optimize their session. The goal with the frontend was to create a modern, slick design that attracted users to use the site. Simplicity was another aspect I included in the site, specially on the results page, displaying the data in a simple yet intuitive way to avoid cognitive load from the users.

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me a couple of lessons regarding project structure and code organization. At first, when the codebase was small, I was coding at light-speed, creating new components and connecting them with existing ones, quickly implementing the basic logic to make the app work.

Then, the project reached a stage where I was getting lost looking for the implementation of a component, the app started to behave in ways I didn't intend it to and navigating through the files was a nightmare.

After a quick structure re-arrangement, I learned that organizing the structure and logic of your code is as important as the code itself. The progress of the project was delayed a couple of days just because I had to re-organize the logic of my components to obtain the desired result. So yeah, from now on, Structure and logic first, then the code.
